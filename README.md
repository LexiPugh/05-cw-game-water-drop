# charity: water – Water Drop Game Starter
In this game, users collect as many falling water drops as possible while avoiding pollutants (bad drops). Users tap to collect drops before they hit the ground. Include a score counter, feedback messages, and penalties for "bad drops" to make it more engaging. You’ll be working from a partially built version of the game. Some functionality is already provided, and your job is to complete the rest.

## What’s Already Done

The starter files already include:

- A **heading and tagline**
- A **start button**
- A **game container** where water drops appear
- A **placeholder timer and score** (not functional yet)
- A **logo image** from charity: water
- Working code that:
  - Starts the game when the start button is clicked
  - Makes water drops fall randomly
  - Randomly chooses between good drops (blue) and bad drops (red)
  - Makes drops disappear when clicked


## What You Need to Add

Here’s what you're required to implement to bring the game to life:

### Game Functionality

- **Update the score**
  - +1 point for each good drop clicked  
  - -1 point for each bad drop clicked  

- **Add a 30-second timer**
  - When the timer reaches 0, the game ends  

- **Display a message when the game ends**
  - If the player scores **20 or more points**, show a **winning** message  
  - If the player scores **less than 20 points**, show a **"try again"** message  
  - Store multiple possible messages for both winning and losing in an array  
  - Pick a random message from the array to display each time  

### Visual Styling

- Add **charity: water branding**
  - Use the provided logo  
  - Use the [charity: water brand guidelines](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ct4zYRIwHAtxoNQoeaVwWYPdnruSC6sr/view) to stay on-brand with colors and styling


These are the minimum requirements, but if you'd like an additional challenge go ahead and give the LevelUps a shot! If you have any questions or need any assistance with your code, reach out to the HelpHub or attend a Drop-In Hour. You got this!!
